So in this week I will do something about the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transformation), here I will also list the materails I collect (Also the documents given on Canvas should be taken into consideration)

For my part, I have to know that what's the before-process of DCT and what's the after-process as well.
Before-process part: Assume that there is a figure (Whatever the content it is), it will be cut into several 8*8 pieces according to JEPG standard. (In fact DCT does not have any requirement for the size of image)
After-process part: Quantization aims to reduce the data amount of encoding, which is the process after quantization. (I wouldn't talk very specifically beacuse I am not responsible for this part)
