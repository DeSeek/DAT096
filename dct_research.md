So in this week I will do something about the DCT (Discrete Cosine Transformation), 
here I will also list the materails I collect (Also the documents given on Canvas 
should be taken into consideration)

For my part, I have to know that what's the before-process of DCT and what's the 
after-process as well.
Before-process part: Assume that there is a figure (Whatever the content it is), 
it will be cut into several 8*8 pieces according to JEPG standard. (In fact DCT 
does not have any requirement for the size of image)
After-process part: Quantization aims to reduce the data amount of encoding, which 
is the process after quantization. (I wouldn't talk very specifically beacuse I am 
not responsible for this part)

two-dimensional DCT enables us to transfer space domain data to frequency domain 
data and compress the low frequency component.
## YCbCr & RGB
Basically both YCbCr and RGB are the expression approach of color.
RGB: As is shown in its name, RGB is a model with the superposition of three entirely
colors, whose names are red, blue and green. We use a hexical value to express what 
the exact color it is. (e.g 000000H means pure white and FFFFFFH means pure black)
YCbCr: The same as RGB, YCbCr also gets three different components, however, Y means 
Luminance and Cb&Cr mean Chromincance which stand for color. It is a better way to use 
for image compression.
